##Self Driving Car using Neural Networks

Build a fully autonomous vehicle prototype which captures live frames and distance and send it to Keras neural network model and take actions to navigate itself according to the inputs from the dynamic environment.

It is implemented in Python integrated with Raspberry Pi as the client processor for sending data frames and distances calculated from the ultrasonic sensor to the keras model on the server system via socket programming.

## Getting Started 

There are set of txt files with complete guide for running on your local machine for development and testing purpose.
