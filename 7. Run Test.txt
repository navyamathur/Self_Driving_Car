1. Now open the final_test.py file in the server pc and the your car controling file, stream_client.py and ultrasonic.py in the Pi terminal.
2. We will run the three files simultaneously using Threads.
3. Set the IP addressses of the Server in each of the threads
4. Give different port numbers to all the three threads and corresponding to the three files of the Pi.
5. Start the server program final_test.py then the three files.
6. Pi camera is streaming video frames and sending to the server then the ultrasonic sensor is sending the distances to the server.
7. Then the server is making the dicisions according to the model's prediction and sending the results of the direction to move back to the Pi.
8. The drive_thread takes the prediction and then takes the car navigation directions.
9. If the streaming detects stop sign then instructs the drive_thread to stop.
10. If the streaming detects traffic lights then find the color of the traffic lights if red then instructs the drive_thread to stop and wait untill green.
